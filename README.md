## Introduction

For my capstone project, I built a personal book note-taking system designed to capture and organize key insights from books. 

The system allows readers to store detailed notes, rate the books, and track when they were read. Books can be sorted by rating and recency, offering an intuitive way to manage and review reading experiences. 

This project showcases the functionality of a personalized reading database, making it easier to retain and revisit the most important information from books.
